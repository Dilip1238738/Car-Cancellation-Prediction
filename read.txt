YOURCABS - CAPSTONE PROJECT

The business problem tackled here is trying to improve customer service for 
YourCabs.com, a cab company in Banglore.

The problem of interest is booking cancellations by the company due to 
unavailability of a car. The challenge is that canccellations can occur  very
close to the trip start time, thereby causing passengers inconvenience.

The goal of the competition is to create a predictive model for classifying
new bookings as to whether they will eventually gets cancelled due to car 
unavailability.
